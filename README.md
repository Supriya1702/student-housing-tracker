# Student Housing Tracker  

The **Student Housing Tracker** aims to make finding on- and off-campus housing easier for students. This platform’s main goal is to create a centralized place where students can learn how to navigate the transition and improve the effectiveness of housing searches.  

The lack of guidance and the scattered nature of housing information often lead to confusion and stress. There are seemingly endless aspects to consider, ranging from affordability and convenience to utilities and distance. With the recent housing crisis affecting the campus, the **Student Housing Tracker** will hopefully provide a smoother experience for students and everyone involved.
